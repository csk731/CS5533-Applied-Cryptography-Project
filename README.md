# Enhancing Telehealth System's Security through ECC, ChaCha20, SHA-3

**Project Introduction**

- In the current digital era, telehealth platforms are crucial for providing healthcare services, yet they're constantly struggling with serious security and privacy issues.
- Using the most recent cryptographic frameworks and techniques, this study pushes the boundaries of existing practice while securing patient data transmissions.
- This study uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) used to create robust keys, which offers strong security and minimal complexity for computation.
- The ChaCha20 for super fast data encryption and SHA-3 for ensuring the data stays unaltered during its journey between the client and server which here refers to the patient and care provider.
- The two main issues it addresses are Unauthorized Access, where the confidentiality of medical records may be compromised by hackers, and Data Integrity Attacks, where patient data integrity is constantly in threat and even a small change could have a major impact on medical outcomes and violate HIPAA compliance. Because breaches are serious because they expose private health information, may compromise patient care, and provide a multi-layered protection against unauthorized access while protecting patient privacy from online attacks.
- It addresses not only the technical challenges but also supports compliance with legal standards, highlighting the power of combined solutions to tackle the complex security and privacy challenges we face today.
